Title: Bayesian model selection for group studies in R
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Matteo", "Lisi", email = "matte.crash@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: R package to perform Bayesian model selection at the group level, i.e. by treating the model as a random effect and allowing different participants to use different models to generate their behavior (see Stephan, Penny, Daunizeau, Moran, and Friston. Bayesian model selection for group studies. NeuroImage, 46(4):1004â€“1017, 2009, for a description of the approach). The R code in this package is largely based on Matlab code present in SPM12 and the VBA toolbox.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.4)
